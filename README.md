# Investment Analysis Project
A data analysis report for Spark Funds, an asset management company. Spark Funds wants to make investments in a few companies. The CEO of Spark Funds wants to understand the global trends in investments so that she can take the investment decisions effectively.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING -
Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:

 1. It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment

 2. It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of        communication with the companies it would invest in

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Goals of data analysis: Your goals are divided into three sub-goals:

1. Investment type analysis: Comparing the typical investment amounts in the venture, seed, angel, private equity etc. so that Spark Funds can choose the type that is best suited for their strategy.
2. Country analysis: Identifying the countries which have been the most heavily invested in the past. These will be Spark Fundsâ€™ favourites as well.
3. Sector analysis: Understanding the distribution of investments across the eight main sectors.
